### What I learned

This is my first project using Sass and the BEM methodology so it really helped me to better understand this tools.

Also I had never heard of the overflow property before (really useful), nor this way of using the background-position property.

```css
.properties {
  overflow-y: hidden;
  background-position: right 50vw bottom 50vh, left 50vw top 50vh;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to focus on improving my responsive design skills, and start using a mobile-first approach.
